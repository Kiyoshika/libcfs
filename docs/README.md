# libcfs Documentation
Note that as of 22 September 2024, this library is still early in development and a lot of things are subject to change. Take this documentation with a grain of salt.

When in doubt, it may be useful to look at the [tests](./tests) for real, up-to-date example code.

## Error Handling
Some functions in this library use a custom result type for more complex error handling. It's recommended to read about the [result](RESULT.md) API on how it's used.

## Paths
For information about constructing paths, see the [path](PATH.md) API.
